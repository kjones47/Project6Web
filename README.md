Simone is a play on Simon the classic memory game toy. You click the buttons and repeat the pattern played. The notes are A, C, E and G on piano corresponding to the green, yellow, blue, and pink button. Click the star in the middle to start playing. The top buttons function as a title and description. The bottom left labeled high scores should access the database and retrieve the highest numbers of correct repetition. The bottom right labeled themes should let you change the theme. The themes would be more colorful and pastel themes since simone the female version of simon. That was the idea. 

On Nov.14 I made the project on android studio. On Nov.16 I created a surface class and wanted to draw the classic toy. On Nov.19 I messed with the content xml and drew out the home screen. On Nov.21 I decided to switch from surface to using buttons and made the ui with clickable buttons and labels. On Nov.22 I added sound to the floating button from youtube and created a start game method. On Nov 23 I added local sound files. On Nov.24 commit and submit.
